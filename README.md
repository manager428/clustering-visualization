## Clustering Visualization

### Background

### Functionality & MVP
- [ ] Display D3 visualization of k-means clustering algorithm in 2D and 3D diagrams
- [ ] Users can scroll through page to view different points in the algorithm
- [ ] Complete narrative/description of each point in the clustering algorithm
- [ ] Design a clean user interface including animations for the 2D and 3D diagrams

### Technologies & Technical Challenges

This data visualization will be implemented using:
- Django as our backend framework
- PostgreSQL as our database
- D3 to create our 2D and 3D visualization
- CSS/HTML for styling the webpage

The primary technical challenges will be:
- Finding a suitable dataset for display (attributes must be as descriptive as possible)
- Learning to create animated diagrams using D3

The data visualization will be created on our own k-means clustering algorithm, in 2 dimensions and 3 dimensions. We will be displaying intermediate steps in the algorithm to show the process. Our final goal is to have our algorithm group all the data points into clusters based on similar attributes.

### Things We Accomplished Over the Weekend
1. Prepared the sample data set to learn how to use D3
- Followed online tutorials to help guide us through the process
2. Used D3 to visualized our sample data set in 2D
3. Learned basic Python and Django to prepare for the week's work
4. Setup our flex project repo on Github
